This is the year where I truly made a name for myself in high school basketball. I had an entire season of senior basketball under my belt as well as a competitive aau season, playing for Team Murray. This year most of us had more hunger to win our league, especially myself and two of my other teammates who had lost to St. Mary’s three years in a row in the finals. Throughout the season I had many high scoring games and was often face guarded because I was big threat from the 3pt line. My team finished the season in first place with only 1 loss to St. Mary’s. That meant the D8 finals was going to be hosted on our home court. We filled up both bleachers, around 5 rows of 20 chairs along the baseline, and we had people standing at the back. It was the most packed gym I had ever played at that point in my career. I started the first quarter with 3 triples so St. Mary’s put their best off ball defender on me for the remainder of the game. My coach decided to keep me on the floor as spacer since my defender wasn’t helping off; it opened up lanes for the rest of my teammates to score. St. Mary’s kept the game close, but we pulled away in the fourth quarter, lead by my best friend and high school teammate, Aidan Whalen. He finished the game with a career-high 23 points and had the entire gym on their feet. We finally did it! We defeated St. Mary’s and were named D8 senior boys basketball champions. <br/><br/>
Moving onto regionals we were expected to play a public school by the name of Eastwood in the finals. We previously beat them in the semi-final match of the Bennies Tournament earlier that year. However, our dreams were cut short when we lost to an underdog team from Guelph and hard fought semi-final game. That brought an end to my grade 12 year. <br/><br/>
After the season was over, my coach called me to his office during class. When I got there he told me he had some big news. He said that the leagues coaches came together awarded me with a first-team all star and league MVP. This was the next best possible way to end my grade 12 season other than going to OFSAA and competing for the provincial championship. I really could not have done it without the help of my teammates, coaches, and family. They all trusted and believed in my abilities to play basketball and helped put me in the best position to succeed. <br/><br/>
The following year I made the decision to return to high school of a 5th year to hopefully get recruited by some Canadian Universities. However, it almost didn’t happen because in August 2019 I was playing at a local community center and I was undercut going up for a layup. I flipped over and tried to break the fall with my hand and ended up breaking both the bones in my right arm. When the doctors saw my x-ray they said I was going to need surgery to but the bones back into place and I was going to be out for at least 2 months. I now have 2 metal plates in my right arm for the rest of my life. I was lucky enough to get my cast off early because the plates were holding my arm together. I wasn’t told by my surgeon to go to therapy, so I rehabbed it all myself and was able to start shooting and dribbling again by late October/early November. I missed the first couple league games and tournaments but I was back playing again by December. My first few games back at a tournament in Niagara Falls, I averaged around 20pts/game, we won the tournament, and I was named as 1 of 5 tournament all-stars. Throughout the season, I picked up interest from Waterloo, Windsor, McMaster, and Lakehead. I was more than happy to be recruited by these schools because after breaking my arm I was unsure if I’d be able to play basketball at the same level as I did before. After, my season was over I went visits to Mac, Waterloo, and Windsor. Coach Cheng did a great job selling the program to my family and I so I made the decision to commit to The University of Windsor.
