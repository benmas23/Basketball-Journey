The first year of my university career was cancelled due to covid but I still moved down to Windsor to train with some of the local guys and whoever else decided to come to town. I moved into a house with two of my fellow 1st year recruits. Despite all the covid restrictions, we had a very busy basketball schedule. We had Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday 6:30am lifts at a local high performance gym called ETS. Then three times a week we had skills training in the Fieldhouse on campus. Finally, we had scrimmages with the Junior Lancers 3 times a week. Even though we didn’t have any games I enjoyed building those relationships with my teammates early on and having the chance to live away from home for the first time. <br/><br/>
In my second year I came back to Windsor in August to begin practices with the team. Those were some of the most competitive practices that we had because they announced that were having a season so we were all overly excited to be back playing again. Heading into the season I didn’t expect to play very much if at all. I didn’t see any court time in the preseason games and then only played 6 minutes total in our first 3 games of the season. However, after losing to Waterloo my coach decided to switch things up and throw me into the rotation. I finished with 7 points, 4 rebounds, and 2 steals in 28 minutes. From then on I was a part of the regular rotation. I played a total of 322 minutes in 16 games, starting in 6 of them. Unfortunately, we ended up losing in the first round of playoffs to Lakehead. Overall, I didn’t play very well statistically but I was very lucky to get the experience under my belt. <br/><br/>
After my first season I decided I was going to live in Windsor for the summer so I could have access to a gym and weight room everyday. My assistant coaches ran skills sessions and few times a week and we had open runs in the evenings. I saw a lot of improvement in the summer and I was excited to show my coach how much better I had gotten. <br/><br/>
However, I didn’t  end up playing as well as I had hoped in the preseason so my coach didn’t see me as a rotation guy and I was pushed to the end of the bench. I competed everyday at practice in hopes of cracking the rotation but, whatever I was doing wasn’t enough because I still wasn’t playing in games. My coach wasn’t giving me much feedback, so I scheduled a meeting with him. He didn’t provide me with a very clear answer so I just continued to workout outside of practice and then do my best at practice to prove to him that I was good enough. I never got into the rotation throughout the entire Fall 2022 semester. I scheduled another meeting with my coach and I thought it would be best for my career if I transferred schools. So, I made the very tough decision to leave the team and Christmas and go back home to Cambridge. I am currently taking two online courses to maintain my eligibility for next year so I can play basketball at whatever school I decide to go to. It is unfortunate that Windsor didn’t work out for me, but I had to do what was best for my own mental health and basketball career. I am now looking at couple different Universities and Colleges in my area with hopes to play somewhere else in Fall 2023.
